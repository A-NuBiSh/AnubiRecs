    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Koshari is hearty vegan meal made with lentil rice, pasta, chickpeas, vinegar, tomato sauce, and topped with crispy thin fried onion rings. Many koshari recipes only have a cooked red vinegar sauce, while some have two types of red sauce, a fresh red sauce and a cooked vinegar red sauce.</p>

    <h3>Koshari Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rice.</strong> Use Egyptian rice (also known as Calrose short-grain rice).</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Lentils.</strong> Usage of brown lentils is strongly recommended for the right koshari experience; however, green lentils can be substituted.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions.</strong> You can use white onion, brown onion, yellow onion, or red onion.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes.</strong> I like to use tomatoes on thevine or Roma tomatoes. Beefsteak tomatoes work just fine. I dont't recommend using canned tomatoes in this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Paste.</strong> Any type of tomato paste will do for this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic.</strong> Using fresh garlic is recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>White Vinegar.</strong> I use distilled white vinegar. I don't recommend using any other type of vinegar because it will change the flavor of the koshari vinegar red sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Crushed Red Pepper.</strong> Just a pinch of crushed red pepper. Alternatively, use ground chilli powder or fresh chilli pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices.</strong> This authentic Egyptian koshari recipe needs ground cumin, ground coriander, and ground chilli powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Chickpeas.</strong> Dried chickpeas are recommended. However, canned chickpeas can be substituted to save some time.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta.</strong> Traditional koshari uses white pasta, but a healthier alternative is whole wheat pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil.</strong> Any type of oil can be used.</li>
    </ul>

            <h4>Making the koshari:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the Chickpeas and fry the onions:</strong> Boil the chickpeas with cumin while preparing the fried onions. Once the chickpeas are tender, add a squeeze of lime on top. Then chop the onions into thin circles and allow them tossed in flour to rest for 30 minutes prior to frying. Fry the onions in the oil until golden brown, the nput them on a paper towel lined plate.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the fresh red sauce (optional):</strong> Make the fresh red sauce. Add the bell pepper, tomatoes, onion, garlic cloves, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, pepper, lime juice, and some oil from the fried onions in a food processor. Blend on high and then set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the koshari lentil rice:</strong> Prepare the koshari lentil rice by blending the peeled onion in the food processor. Then, add some oil to a high-rimmed pot and fry the blended onions for about 15 minutes on medium-low heat. After that, add the soaked brown lentils and water to the cooked onions. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Finally, turn down the heat to medium-low and add the rice and more water. Add salt and pepper and mix the rice. Cover and cook for about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep the rice covered.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the pasta and koshari red vinegar sauce:</strong> Cook the pasta unti <em>al dente</em> per the package instructions while making the tomato vinegar chili sauce. Then blend the tomatoes in a blender. Pour the pureed tomatoes into a strainer. Use a spoon to press the blended tomatoes through the strainer. In a medium saucepan, on high heat, add some oil and fry the red pepper flakes (or cayenne pepper) and minced garlic for about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and hwite vinegar for about 30 seconds. Add the strained tomatoes. Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, sugar and ground pepper. After that, boil on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Add a chili pepper if desired.
