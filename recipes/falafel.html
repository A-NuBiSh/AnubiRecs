        <h2 class="fooddesc">Description:</h2>
        <div class="lightbackground">
        <p class= "mainbodytext desc">Traditional falafel is made from ground chickpeas or fava beans, herbs and spices. The mixture is then formed into balls or patties and deep fried for a texture that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sort of like a fritter. It's a classic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean recipe that's enjoyed as street food and often served up as part of mezze (group of small meals).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Falafel Ingredients:</h3>
        <div class="lightbackground">
        <ul class="inglist mainbodytext">
            <li><strong>Chickpeas</strong>: Only use dried and soaked chickpeas, not canned chickpeas in this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Onions</strong>: Usually yellow onions are used for a slightly stronger flavor, but you could use white or red onion as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Parsley</strong> and <strong>Cilantro</strong>: these two delicious herbs inject heaps of flavor into your falafel and turn the inside a beautiful, vibrant green.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Use fresh garlic cloves rather than garlic powder for the most robust flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Green Chile Pepper</strong>: A small pepper adds a kick of flavor and spice without over-powering the falafel. You can adjust this to more or less, but don't omit it without trying it first.</li>
            <li><strong>Cumin, Cardamom, Salt, and Black Pepper</strong>: These aromatic spices are used often in Middle Eastern cooking and have an earthy, spicy assertive flavor you'll love.</li>
            <li><strong>Chickpea Flour</strong>: This helps to bind the mixture together and retain the shape while frying. I prefer chickpea flour, but you could also use a gluten-free flour blend.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>: A key ingredient for helping to provide the fluffy inside texture of the falafel.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil for Frying</strong>: I use avocado oil as it's high-heat stable and my preferred cooking oil. But you could use vegetable oil as well.</li>

            <li class="firststep"><!--First part-->
                <h4>Making the Falafel dough mixture:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Soak your dried chickpeas.</strong> Overnight or for at least 8-12 hours. Note that the chickpeas will triple in size, so cover them with plenty of water. Then drain and rinse them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add all the ingredients to a food processor.</strong> Add the chickpeas, onions, parsley, cilantro, garlic, green pepper, and spices to a food processor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer the mixture to a bowl.</strong> Then add the chickpea flour and baking soda, stir it together until it's fully combined and cover with plastic wrap or a lid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Place the bowl in the fridge.</strong> Chill the falafel mixture for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape your falafel.</strong> You can do this by hand, with a cookie scoop or a falafel scoop. Decide if you'd like round balls or flatter patty shapes.</li>

                </ol>
            
            </li>

            <li class="secondpart"><!--Second Part-->
                <h4>Cooking the Falafel (Choose one):</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Deep Fry the Falafel:</strong> Heat about 3 inches of oil in a pot on medium heat to 350F. Once the oil has reached temperature, gently drop 6-8 balls into the oil at a time. Let them cook for 1-2 minutes or until golden on the outside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pan Fry the Falafel:</strong> Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium-high heat. Gently place the falafel in the pan and cook each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake the Falafel:</strong> Pre-heat your oven to 425F. Lightly spray or brush a baking sheet with oil. Place the falafel on the baking sheet, lightly spray or brush the top side with oil and bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway thorugh. You can also bake them on parchment paper or a silicone mat without any oil. They'll just be slightly less crispy and golden.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
